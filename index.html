      <h3>Nafisah Islam</h3>
      <p> Hi. I'm a third year student at City University of London. I've coded before in Python
          and now can code in Java. 
          I have many interests and my greatest joy in life is my cat Link.

    <h3>Java Project: Chick Rescue</h3>
    <p>
	My Java project is 2D platform game based around a chicken rescuing a chick. There are four levels the chicken	
	has to go through, navigating between platforms, collecting eggs whilst avoiding enemies such 
	as foxes, farmers and tumbleweed. I used the City Engine Physics library to build my game. Through this project 
    I learnt and made use of inheritance to structure complex code such as having a base level class and many different 
    specific levels that inherit from it. In my game there are multiple complex bodies that have irregular shapes 
    and most bodies respond to collisions, through sound effects, scoring and decrement in lives. I created a GUI on 
    the left which transistions to multiple panels and included an option to save and load files, restart the game,
    pause and resume the game, and control the volume. With the knowledge I gained from timers I implemented rain 
    fall for Level 2 and created a bomb that exploded after a given time, destroying enemy bodies.
    <br> <br>
    The main challenges I encountered in this project was working with files. I was able to save the current game
    state to an external text file but had trouble with the loading function. I was able to load the level but 
    not the lives, score, dynamic body postions. Another challenge I faced was going to the next level and ensuring 
    the score and lives were carried over. In addition the previous levels background music would play and I had to
    find a way to overcome that.
